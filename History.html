    <p>Christian Methodist Senior High School is a mission school under the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church of Ghana.</p>
    <p>In September, 1960, under the supervision of Bishop E.P. Murchison and financial assistance from the Christian Methodist Episcopal church of the United States of America, Rev. Gordon Quaye and Rev. Dr. Raph Shonyeh Wright founded the Christian Methodist Secondary School. The school was located at Asylum Down, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah Circle, in rented premises. The school started with sixteen(16) students.</p>
    <p>Rev. Gordon Quaye however was working full time with the West African Examinations Council. He therefore delegated his duties to other pioneer members of staff like Mr. R. A. Larbi, Rev. E. O. Addy, Mr. Addo-Dankwa and Mr. Opare Addo. From 1960 t0 1965, Christian Methodist Senior High operated as a private institution financed by the church and the school fees of the few students. Due to the high cost of running the school, Rev, Gordon Quaye, with the approval of the church , applied for incorporation into the Public Education System of the Ministry of Education.</p>
    <p>On September 1, 1965, the school was absorbsd into the Ghana Education Service as a government assisted secondary school.</p>
    <p>Mr. R. A. Mensah became the first substantive Headmaster of the school. He was initially seconded to the school from the Ministry of Education and later confirmed as the Headmaster. In May 1979, the Ministry of Education appointed Mr. E. A.  Apeadu to succeed Mr. R. A. Mensah. Mr. E. A. Apeadu was later transferredd to Presec, Lagon as the Headmaster and was replaced by Miss Elsie Yaw. Mr. P. A. K. Badu-Prah then succeeded Miss Elsie Yaw in 1987. On 25<sup>th</sup> October, 1991, Mr E. S. E. Okyere took over as Headmaster until 1999 when he went on retirement and was replaced by Mrs. Emelia Addy. Mrs. Emelia Addy was the substantive Headmistress until 3<sup>rd</sup> October, 2008 when she handed over the administration of the school to Mr. J. Nii Okaija Dinsey, the then Accra Metro Director of Education while she proceeded on retirement from the Ghana Education Service.</p>
